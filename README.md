This is my main repository for the class CS 260 and for my personal website which will be BuyZip

# What is BuyZip?
How many times in our lives have do we have left over or forgotten about stuff. Weather it's an old computer lying about or an old mattress your looking to get rid of, sometimes the clutter is unwanted and can be an eye sore. In cases like this, I'm proud to introduce BuyZip!

BuyZip is an online platform to sell unwanted items that you have lying about and a great place to buy regular or more niche items that you've been looking for. Once you create an free account, feel free to browse any items currently for sale in our database and if your looking to sell, feel free to register an item online so that people all over the world can buy it! We look forward to shopping with you! 

# What Technologies are used?
There are a verity of technologies that are going to be used for a variety of purposes. I'll be using html, css and javascript to build the foundations of the website. We will be using Mongo DB to store all of the user data as well as any items and their prices on the market place. We'll also use websockets to provide live data on which items are currently being made available by other users. More specific definitions are in the discription below
