This is my main repository for the class CS 260 and for my personal website which will be BuyZip

# What is BuyZip?
How many times in our lives have do we have left over or forgotten about stuff. Weather it's an old computer lying about or an old mattress your looking to get rid of, sometimes the clutter is unwanted and can be an eye sore. In cases like this, I'm proud to introduce BuyZip!

BuyZip is an online platform to sell unwanted items that you have lying about and a great place to buy regular or more niche items that you've been looking for. Once you create an free account, feel free to browse any items currently for sale in our database and if your looking to sell, feel free to register an item online so that people all over the world can buy it! We look forward to shopping with you! 

## Sample pages 
Below are some sample pages of what the website may look like


## What Technologies are used?
There are a verity of technologies that are going to be used for a variety of purposes. I'll be using html, css and javascript to build the foundations of the website. We will be using Mongo DB to store all of the user data as well as any items and their prices on the market place. We'll also use websockets to provide live data on which items are currently being made available by other users. More specific definitions are in the discription below
- HTML - Will be used to create the basic page structure for the website as well as being the primary place to create buttons, divs, and text. In short, it will be the foundation of my website.
- CSS - Will provide allow me to customize and design my website such that it will look professional and clean.
- Javascript - Allows me to add functionality to my website and to many of the different features on my webpages. Buttons, forms, and user inputs/activity will all be handled by Javascript.
- React - Along with HTML and CSS, allows me to customize and build interfaces that are more sophisticated for my website
- Node.js - Will be the main language that my server is coded in. Will also make it easier for me to debug and test. 
- MongoDB - Stores critical information about the website and makes it accessable. Information about users, items for sale and authentication will all be stored on the database for safekeeping.
- Websockets - Allows for live information to be displayed. Items being put up for sale will be sent through a websocket so that all other users immediately know about the item.
- Fetch API - In order to communcate between the client and server, Fetch API is needed to send and recieve messages. As the client needs to send information to update the server it send it via Fetch through https/http messages.
- Endpoints - The website will have a series of critical endpoints that implement key features. These will be built on the server side and the client will communicate through them.
