## What Technologies are used?
There are a verity of technologies that are going to be used for a variety of purposes. I'll be using html, css and javascript to build the foundations of the website. We will be using Mongo DB to store all of the user data as well as any items and their prices on the market place. We'll also use websockets to provide live data on which items are currently being made available by other users. More specific definitions are in the discription below
- HTML - Will be used to create the basic page structure for the website as well as being the primary place to create buttons, divs, and text. In short, it will be the foundation of my website.
- CSS - Will provide allow me to customize and design my website such that it will look professional and clean.
- Javascript - Allows me to add functionality to my website and to many of the different features on my webpages. Buttons, forms, and user inputs/activity will all be handled by Javascript.
- React - Along with HTML and CSS, allows me to customize and build interfaces that are more sophisticated for my website
- Node.js - Will be the main language that my server is coded in. Will also make it easier for me to debug and test. 
- MongoDB - Stores critical information about the website and makes it accessable. Information about users, items for sale and authentication will all be stored on the database for safekeeping.
- Websockets - Allows for live information to be displayed. Items being put up for sale will be sent through a websocket so that all other users immediately know about the item.
- Fetch API - In order to communcate between the client and server, Fetch API is needed to send and recieve messages. As the client needs to send information to update the server it send it via Fetch through https/http messages.
- Endpoints - The website will have a series of critical endpoints that implement key features. These will be built on the server side and the client will communicate through them.

# Updates and Progress

* first update: So I created my first couple of files and pushed them to git hub, I also made a client folder just so my repo is a bit more orgaized.

# How do you make a responsive design?
We can block thing, use a flex design, or many differnt options. For flex, be sure to put flex in class name(or anything) and then put display: flex and then do flex-direction:row to make it grow and shrink depending on what you want to do. So, you want to make html functional and css make it stylish. Float allows stuff to just float have stuff wrap around it. portrait mode
