# Backed info

- This is the backend for my startup service project. Here you will see that I have a few notes about what is located here in this file as well as some helpful tips that I think would be useful. To begin, index.js is mainly used as an entry point of sorts for this api. it has all of the endpoints and the rest of the folders inside of this file are used for handlng http requests and getting items from my database.
-  Not all of these things are added yet, but in future updates for this webasite they will be here
